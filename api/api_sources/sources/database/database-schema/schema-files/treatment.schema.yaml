    description: 'An application of a mechanical or cultural control. Mechanical weed control employs various implements and techniques to physically disturb weeds or to interrupt their reproduction by depleting root reserves through repeated defoliation of the plant. Mechanical control includes the mowing, ploughing, chopping, and crushing of weeds.
    Cultural control includes selective grazing, irrigation and deliberate flooding, mulching, hand pulling, and burning. Strategies and timing should depend on the weed species and its location in the province.'
